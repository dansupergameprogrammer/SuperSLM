// T-2113 (B1): production implementation of the 1.0 GPU API's context lifecycle
// (Claude/Vitruvius/t2107-gpu-core-1p0-design-2026-08-14.md Sec4.1.1, Sec10 B1).
//
// B1's own gate (design Sec10): "existing suite green, unchanged behavior when
// exactly one context is created (a same-process, same-thread equivalence check
// against the substrate's own current single-call behavior)". Concretely: this file
// adds a NEW, additive construction (SslmGpuContext, its own owned harness::Device
// and PSO/root-sig caches) that touches none of the pre-1.0 substrate's own process-
// global statics (`harness::GetDevice()`, `harness::GetOrBuildPipeline`,
// `harness::GetOrBuildComposedPipeline`, all still defined in d3d12_harness.h and
// still used unchanged by `RunLayerLoopGpu` and every other pre-1.0 entry point in
// superslm_gpu.cpp) -- so the existing test suite (tests\test_main.cpp,
// out\superslm_tests.exe) observes zero behavior change. The migration that actually
// removes the pre-1.0 singleton usage from RunLayerLoopGpu's own dispatch-recording
// path is B2/B4's job (design Sec10: B2 folds the T-2105 residency construction onto
// the model handle's own upload path; B4 ports the dispatch geometry onto the new
// handle shapes) -- B1 only builds the object the later sections will route weights,
// PSOs, and dispatches through instead of the singleton, per D-SLM3294's own
// "no process-global device state in the 1.0 backend" requirement (design Sec1).
//
// Symbols DEFINED here: sslm_gpu_context_create, sslm_gpu_context_destroy.
// Every other declaration in include/superslm/gpu_1p0.h stays declared-only until
// its own B-section lands (B2 through B9); this file is the single production TU
// the whole 1.0 API grows in, one B-section at a time -- calling out its own
// section boundary in comments as later sections extend it, mirroring
// src/gpu/superslm_gpu.cpp's own established convention for the pre-1.0 surface.

// static), and its own PSO/root-signature caches, keyed exactly the way the
// pre-1.0 singleton caches were (by shader base name) so the later B-sections that
// port dispatch-recording code onto this object can reuse that code's own lookup
// shape unchanged -- only the cache's OWNER moves.
